The food industry is rapidly evolving, with an increasing demand for automated solutions to enhance customer experience and streamline operations. One major challenge is accurately identifying and classifying food items from images, a critical need for various applications such as restaurant automation, calorie tracking, and food delivery platforms. Misclassification can lead to incorrect recommendations, inefficient inventory management, and poor customer satisfaction.
